        <h2>Descrition</h2>
        <p>
            Operation Democles will attack the planet Tranquil. As Connor Sinclair, you're leading the Democles
            Commando<br>
            team lance, part of the Eridani Light Horse, on the attack. The op went terribly wrong when one of the
            two<br>
            drop ships was hit during descent, and your lancemates have been scattered to the four winds in the
            frenzied<br>
            drop. You must attack through Clan territory, meet up with your lancemates, remove any resistance in
            your<br>
            path, and try to find a way off the planet, while also accomplishing what you came to do: destroy the
            Smoke<br>
            Jaguars!

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <blockquote>In conclusion, you can tell I really enjoyed playing Mechwarrior 3. It provides an innovative and<br>
            fun style of gameplay, which is incomparable to anything else in the simulation genre. The developers have<br>
            really put a lot of attention into the detail of the game, and it shows. So gear up, strap in and start<br>
            blasting away in your 100-ton machine of devastation, the ride is killer!
