        <h3>Description</h3>


        Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The<br>
        only weapon
        that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]<br>

        This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a<br>
        good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
